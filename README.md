# 📂 Smart File Organizer

A Python-based file organizer that automatically sorts files in a folder into categories like **Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Scripts, and Others** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## ✅ Features
✔ Organizes files into **categories** based on their extensions  
✔ **Simple CLI** (Command Line Interface) for easy use  
✔ **Handles unknown extensions** by moving them to `Others`  
✔ Creates folders automatically if they don't exist  
✔ **Cross-platform** (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## ✅ How It Works
- In Main.py Run the code
- Input a folder path
- The program scans all files in the folder
- Files are moved into folders:
  - `Images` → `.jpg, .png, .gif`
  - `Documents` → `.pdf, .docx, .txt`
  - `Videos` → `.mp4, .mkv`
  - `Audio` → `.mp3, .wav`
  - `Archives` → `.zip, .rar`
  - `Scripts` → `.py, .js, .html`
  - `Others` → All unknown extensions
